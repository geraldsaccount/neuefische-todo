# Neue Fische To-Do App

This project was developed as part of a bootcamp assignment to practice backend development skills. The task involved creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with a fully functional backend, while the frontend was provided by the bootcamp.

### Project Goal

The goal was to implement a backend system capable of managing to-do items through RESTful API endpoints. The backend supports operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting to-do items, ensuring seamless integration with the provided frontend.

### Endpoints

The backend exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

- `POST /todos` - Create a new to-do item.
- `GET /todos` - Retrieve all to-do items.
- `GET /todos/:id` - Retrieve a specific to-do item by ID.
- `PUT /todos/:id` - Update a specific to-do item by ID.
- `DELETE /todos/:id` - Delete a specific to-do item by ID.

### Focus on Testing

A major focus of this project was on ensuring code quality and reliability through unit and integration tests. Comprehensive test coverage was implemented to validate the functionality of the API endpoints, data handling, and error scenarios.

### Technologies

- **Backend Framework**: Spring
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests to ensure robust functionality.

### Learning Objectives

- Building RESTful APIs
- Implementing CRUD operations
- Writing and executing unit and integration tests
- Understanding backend-to-frontend integration
